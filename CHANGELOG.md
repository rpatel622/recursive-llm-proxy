All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-15

### Migration notes

- Replace `RLM.completion(...)` with `RLM.complete(...)` and `RLM.acompletion(...)` with
  `RLM.acomplete(...)`.
- The default `max_depth` is now `1` instead of `5`. Depth follows the paper's capability-based
  convention: `0` enables only the root REPL, `1` permits plain-LM subcalls, and `2` permits one
  child RLM level with a plain-LM boundary fallback.

### Added

- Tree-wide call, token, cost, and elapsed-time budgets with partial statistics on budget errors.
- Structured completion results with exact per-run statistics and root/child/leaf trajectories.
- Safe concurrent use of the same `RLM` instance through isolated per-invocation state.
- Optional POSIX memory, CPU-time, and open-file limits for REPL workers.
- Deterministic long-context benchmark generation, exact task graders, repeated runs, direct-model
  baselines, JSONL output, and checked-in live benchmark results.
- GitHub Actions checks across Python 3.9-3.12 on Linux and Python 3.12 on macOS and Windows.
- Security guidance describing the REPL isolation model and its trust boundary.

### Changed

- Aligned recursion-depth behavior and documentation with the RLM paper's depth convention.
- Hardened REPL execution with spawned workers, persistent state, hard local-step timeouts, bounded
  output, restricted imports, and ordered bounded-concurrency subcalls.
- Aggregated usage and best-effort cost statistics across the complete recursion tree.
- Updated repository, installation, citation, release, and issue links to `grishahq/recursive-llm`.
- Expanded the test suite from 43 initial-release tests to 133 tests with enforced branch coverage.

### Fixed

- Required final-answer directives to be standalone executable statements instead of accepting
  occurrences embedded in arbitrary text.
- Prevented models from guessing context contents before inspecting the REPL context.
- Corrected parameter handling for GPT-5-family models.
- Prevented REPL worker pipe errors from leaking tracebacks during budget-triggered shutdown.
- Corrected offline-demo aggregation and strengthened benchmark numeric-boundary grading.
