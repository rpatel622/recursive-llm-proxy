# Recursive Language Models (RLM)

Python implementation of Recursive Language Models for efficient long-context processing. Context
stays in a Python REPL so models can inspect relevant parts and reduce token usage on large-context
tasks.

**Based on the [RLM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601) by Alex L. Zhang, Tim Kraska, and Omar Khattab** | [Official implementation](https://github.com/alexzhang13/rlm)


## What is RLM?

RLM enables language models to process extremely long contexts (100k+ tokens) by:
- Storing context as a Python variable instead of in the prompt
- Allowing the LM to recursively explore and partition the context
- Using local search and computation to reduce model token usage on suitable long-context tasks
- Avoiding "context rot" (performance degradation with long context)

Instead of this:
```python
llm.complete(prompt="Summarize this", context=huge_document)  # Context rot!
```

RLM does this:
```python
rlm = RLM(model="gpt-5-mini")
result = rlm.complete(
    query="Summarize this",
    context=huge_document  # Stored as variable, not in prompt
)
```

The LM can then peek, search, and recursively process the context adaptively.

## Installation

**Note:** This package is not yet published to PyPI. Install from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/grishahq/recursive-llm.git
cd recursive-llm

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Or install with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**Future:** Once published to PyPI, you'll be able to install with `pip install recursive-llm`

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- An API key for your chosen LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Or a local model setup (Ollama, llama.cpp, etc.)

## Quick Start

```python
from rlm import RLM

def main():
    # Initialize with any LLM
    rlm = RLM(model="gpt-5-mini")

    # Process long context
    result = rlm.complete(
        query="What are the main themes in this document?",
        context=long_document,
    )
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

RLM uses a spawned worker process for isolated REPL execution. Executable Python scripts must use
the standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` entry-point guard, as shown above. This is required by
Python multiprocessing on spawn-based platforms; all repository examples follow this pattern.

### Usage and Cost Statistics

`RLM.stats` aggregates model calls across the complete recursion tree. Token usage comes from
provider responses, while cost is calculated on a best-effort basis using LiteLLM's model pricing
metadata.

```python
rlm = RLM(
    model="gpt-5-mini",
    recursive_model="deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash",
)
result = rlm.complete(query="Summarize this", context=document)

print(rlm.stats)
# {
#     "llm_calls": 11,
#     "root_calls": 3,
#     "recursive_calls": 8,
#     "leaf_calls": 4,
#     "prompt_tokens": 12500,
#     "completion_tokens": 3200,
#     "cached_tokens": 6000,
#     "estimated_cost_usd": 0.0047,
#     "by_model": {
#         "gpt-5-mini": {"calls": 3, ...},
#         "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash": {"calls": 8, ...},
#     },
# }
```

Each root completion receives fresh statistics, so they describe one recursion tree rather than
lifetime usage.
`estimated_cost_usd` is `None` when LiteLLM has no pricing metadata for any completed call. Compare
`priced_calls` with `llm_calls` before treating the estimate as the full run cost.

When the same `RLM` instance runs concurrent completions, `RLM.stats` describes whichever root run
completed most recently. Use the structured result API for exact per-run statistics and trajectory:

```python
result = rlm.complete_result(query="Summarize this", context=document)
print(result.answer)
print(result.stats)
for event in result.trajectory:
    print(event.kind, event.depth, event.node_id, event.parent_id)
```

`acomplete_result` is the asynchronous equivalent. Trajectories include the complete root, child
RLM, and leaf-call tree. Query, context, model response, code, and output content are represented by
character counts by default. Set `capture_trajectory_content=True` only when the resulting logs are
allowed to contain that data. An optional `event_handler` receives events as they occur; handler
failures do not interrupt model completion.

### Live Model Comparison

The comparison script uses the same model for both root and recursive calls. It runs one small
recursive smoke test by default and reports latency, calls, tokens, and estimated cost:

```bash
python benchmarks/compare_same_model.py gpt-5-mini
python benchmarks/compare_same_model.py deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash
```

Use repeated runs and save raw records before comparing configurations:

```bash
python benchmarks/compare_same_model.py gpt-5-mini --full --runs 3 --jsonl results.jsonl
python benchmarks/compare_same_model.py gpt-5-mini --full --runs 3 --mode direct
python benchmarks/compare_same_model.py gpt-5-mini --generated-chars 100000 --seed 2026
```

`--max-depth` compares recursion capabilities; `--mode direct` sends task and context in one normal
long-context model request. The script reports pass rate, p50/p95 latency, calls, tokens, and
best-effort cost. Task-specific graders require exact IDs, numeric boundaries, and explicit labeled
counts rather than accepting arbitrary substrings. Live benchmarks make paid API calls and require
the corresponding provider keys. `--trace` includes sensitive content-bearing trajectories in the
JSON output and should be used deliberately.

## API Keys Setup

Copy the example environment file and add keys only for the providers you use:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...
MOONSHOT_API_KEY=...
```

Use the LiteLLM provider prefix for non-OpenAI models, for example
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` or `moonshot/kimi-k2.6`. This lets a hybrid RLM select the correct API
key for each model automatically.

Or pass directly in code:
```python
rlm = RLM(model="gpt-5-mini", api_key="sk-...")
```

## Supported Models

Works with 100+ LLM providers via LiteLLM:

```python
# OpenAI
rlm = RLM(model="gpt-5")
rlm = RLM(model="gpt-5-mini")

# Anthropic
rlm = RLM(model="claude-sonnet-4")
rlm = RLM(model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514")

# Ollama (local)
rlm = RLM(model="ollama/llama3.2")
rlm = RLM(model="ollama/mistral")

# llama.cpp (local)
rlm = RLM(
    model="openai/local",
    api_base="http://localhost:8000/v1"
)

# Azure OpenAI
rlm = RLM(model="azure/gpt-4-deployment")

# And many more via LiteLLM...
```

## Advanced Usage

### Two Models (Optimize Cost)

Use a cheaper model for recursive calls:

```python
rlm = RLM(
    model="gpt-5",              # Root LM (main decisions)
    recursive_model="gpt-5-mini"  # Recursive calls (cheaper)
)
```

### Async API

For better performance with parallel recursive calls:

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    rlm = RLM(model="gpt-5-mini")
    result = await rlm.acomplete(query, context)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Configuration

```python
rlm = RLM(
    model="gpt-5-mini",
    max_depth=2,                 # One child RLM level, then a plain-LM fallback
    max_iterations=20,           # Maximum REPL iterations per RLM
    repl_timeout=5,              # Hard timeout for each local Python step
    max_output_chars=2000,       # Observation truncation limit
    max_concurrent_subcalls=4,   # Bound batch concurrency
    max_total_calls=24,          # Exact provider-call cap for the full recursion tree
    max_total_tokens=100_000,    # Stop after reported usage crosses this value
    max_total_cost_usd=0.10,     # Stop after reported cost crosses this value
    max_elapsed_seconds=300,     # Deadline shared by root and child calls
    # Optional LiteLLM params: temperature, timeout, etc.
)
```

Call limits are reserved atomically before provider requests, including batched and recursive
subcalls. Token and cost limits are evaluated after each response because providers only report
those values after generation; the crossing response is included in partial statistics attached to
`BudgetExceededError`. A deadline also bounds in-flight provider requests. All limits are optional
and are reset for each root completion.

`max_depth` is an explicit constructor option so that runs remain reproducible. It is not read from
an environment variable by the library. Applications may map their own configuration or environment
variables to this argument.

| `max_depth` | Behavior |
| ---: | --- |
| `0` | Root RLM and REPL only; no LM subcalls |
| `1` (default) | Root RLM may call a plain LM |
| `2` | Root RLM may create one child RLM; the child falls back to a plain LM |
| `n` | Adds one child RLM level for every increment above `1` |

This follows the paper's capability-based depth convention. The root RLM itself is depth `0` and is
still valid when `max_depth=0`.

### REPL Subcall API

The model can use these functions from its persistent REPL:

```python
# One plain LM call, without another REPL loop
llm_query("Extract the date", context[1000:2000])

# Child RLM when depth permits; otherwise one plain-LM boundary call
rlm_query("Analyze this section", context[2000:8000])

# Ordered parallel calls, limited by max_concurrent_subcalls
results = llm_query_batched(queries, chunks)
```

`recursive_llm` remains as a backward-compatible alias for `rlm_query`. A step can finish directly
through `FINAL(...)`, `FINAL_VAR(...)`, or the mutable `answer` object:

```python
answer["content"] = result
answer["ready"] = True
```

## How It Works

1. **Context is stored as a variable** in a Python REPL environment
2. **Root LM gets only the query** plus instructions
3. **LM can explore context** using Python code:
   ```python
   # Peek at context
   context[:1000]

   # Search with regex
   re.findall(r'pattern', context)

   # Recursive processing with a plain-LM boundary fallback
   rlm_query("extract dates", context[1000:2000])
   ```
4. **Returns the final answer** via a standalone `FINAL("answer")`, `FINAL_VAR(name)`, or `answer`
   publication

REPL variables persist between iterations. Each local step executes in an isolated subprocess, its
final expression is evaluated exactly once, print output is isolated per step, and non-terminating
local code is terminated by `repl_timeout`. Time spent waiting for model subcalls is not charged to
the local Python timeout. Imports are limited to the already exposed `re`, `json`, `math`,
`datetime`, and `collections` helpers; arbitrary modules remain blocked.

POSIX deployments may also opt in to worker-process limits:

```python
rlm = RLM(
    model="gpt-5-mini",
    repl_memory_limit_mb=512,
    repl_cpu_time_limit_seconds=10,
    repl_max_open_files=64,
)
```

These values depend on the runtime and workload, so the library does not guess defaults. A
configured limit that the platform cannot enforce fails worker startup explicitly. RestrictedPython
and a subprocess are defense-in-depth controls, not a security boundary for hostile code; read
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before processing untrusted prompts or contexts.

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for complete working examples:
- `basic_usage.py` - Simple complete with OpenAI
- `ollama_local.py` - Using Ollama locally
- `two_models.py` - Cost optimization with two models
- `long_document.py` - Processing 50k+ token documents
- `data_extraction.py` - Extract structured data from text
- `multi_file.py` - Process multiple documents
- `custom_config.py` - Advanced configuration

Run an example:
```bash
# Set your API key first
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Run example
python examples/basic_usage.py
```

## Performance

### Paper Results

On OOLONG benchmark (132k tokens):
- GPT-5: baseline
- RLM(GPT-5-Mini): **33% better than GPT-5** at similar cost

### Reproducible Project Benchmark

`benchmarks/compare_same_model.py` contains deterministic structured contexts with exact expected
answers. `benchmarks/generated_long_context.py` creates byte-reproducible transaction corpora with
seed, SHA-256 identity, and a computed answer key. Model outputs remain stochastic, so use `--runs`
and compare pass rate plus p50/p95 latency before drawing quality conclusions. See
[BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md](BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md) for the latest checked-in live comparison.

## Limitations

- Python REPL steps are sequential; explicit batched LM/RLM subcalls can run concurrently
- No prefix caching (future enhancement)
- Recursion depth is limited (configurable via `max_depth`)
- No streaming support yet

## Troubleshooting

### "Max iterations exceeded"
- Increase `max_iterations` parameter
- Simplify your query
- Check if the model is getting stuck in a loop

### "API key not found"
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the appropriate provider variable:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI
  - `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` for DeepSeek
  - `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` for Kimi
- Or pass `api_key` parameter to RLM constructor

### "Model not found"
- Check model name format for your provider
- See LiteLLM docs: https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers

### Using Ollama
- Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Pull a model first: `ollama pull llama3.2`
- Use model format: `ollama/model-name`
